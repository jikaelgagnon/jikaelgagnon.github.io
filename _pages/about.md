I'm an undegraduate in CS at McGill University interested in machine learning. This summer I'm interning at Mila doing research under Professor Siamak Ravanbaksh.

My research is primarily into equivariant neural networks, which are a special kind of neural network that use group symmetry as an inductive bias. These networks excel at tasks which have natural symmetries such as physics and quantum chemistry.
